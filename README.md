# Alura-Scraper
Scrap all videos from a course you want and you can download'em automatically(downloading is optional).
Attention, you need to be a paid member to work. And nope, I didn't code anything to treat errors like wrong username/password or link yet.

By the way, the links for the video resets daily. Pay attention when downloading.
